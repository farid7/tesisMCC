	\begin{abstract}{english}
The number of proposals of business model has been increasing in the last years, in that way that some organizations that give support to those \textit{start-ups} need to select the ``''best ideas``'' with high chances of success, among a wide variety of applications. For this reason, we propose a methodology for ranking business model applications using text mining techniques and a fuzzy rule based system. We evaluated this proposed methodology using real data applications from a company that evaluates those business proposals.

The applications we ranked consisted in questions and answers, but the business model description is written as the response to some open questions as "What is the need or problem you want to solve with your business idea?" or "What population are you benefiting/helping with your business idea?". For this reason, Natural Language Processing techniques had been applied in order to extract meaningful semantic features from texts, mapping some key-words from applications into a vectorial space. Then, we built an expert system whose rules were created taking into account the technological, social and economical impact of the business idea. Finally, the applications were sorted according to a given score that was assigned by our expert system.

On the other hand, it was trained a system in order to classify ``good applications'' and ``not so good'' aplications. We tested different models and selected those with best results; the labels were assigned according to some score given by expert human judges that assigned an overall score to each one application.\\
